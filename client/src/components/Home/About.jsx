            <p>
              India, a land of diverse cultures, rich heritage, and natural beauty, is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. <br />Known for its vibrant traditions, delicious cuisine, and iconic landmarks such as the Taj Mahal, India offers a unique blend of the ancient and the modern. With over 1.4 billion people, it is a melting pot of languages, religions, and festivals, making it a truly colorful and dynamic nation.
              <br />
              <br />In the words of Mark Twain, “India is the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend and the great-grandmother of tradition.”
